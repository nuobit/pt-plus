Changelog
=========

4.1.6 (2026-07-01)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bugfixes**

- Include the accounting data of company branches and sub-branches in the
  Accounting SAF-T. The G/L accounts (opening/period balances), G/L entries and
  balance warnings now cover the export company and its whole ``child_of`` tree
  (the report is filed per taxpayer at the export company) instead of only the
  selected company, for both the extraction and real-time extraction methods.

4.1.5 (2026-06-24)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bugfixes**

- Preserve an integrated document's ``HashControl`` (SourceBilling=I) in the
  SAF-T export instead of emitting ``0`` (Despacho n.º 8632/2014: collected
  documents are exported as-is).

4.1.4 (2026-06-24)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bugfixes**

- Report the line ``UnitPrice`` and ``SettlementAmount`` in the company
  (reporting) currency for invoices issued in a foreign currency. ``UnitPrice``
  was previously emitted in the document currency and the discount was
  converted with the exchange rate inverted.
- Report the SAF-T line ``References`` (origin document and correction reason)
  on corrective documents, so credit and debit notes can point at the document
  they correct.

4.1.3 (2026-06-16)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Improvement**

- Added a 'Blocked' SAF-T element status that freezes the element and is never
  recomputed. It is set/cleared manually from the invoices and payments list
  ``Action`` menu, and is released only when the document is cancelled.
- Exposed the SAF-T element status as an optional column on the invoices and
  payments lists.
- Added a list action to recompute the SAF-T element on the spot, without
  extracting the SAF-T file.

4.1.2 (2025-11-11)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Features**

- Added special taxes artificial line (IEC/ECO taxes) on Sales Invoices.
- Added artifical Downpayment product, and add it to downpayment invoice and sale order lines (SalesInvoice and WorkDocument).


4.0.1 (2024-01-29)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Features**

- Added a new method to obtain SAF-T using dataport log without using the user interface
  This can be useful for SAF-T extraction automation

4.0.0 (2023-11-16)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Features**

- Initial changelog
